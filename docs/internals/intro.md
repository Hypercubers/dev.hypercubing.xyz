# Introduction

The goal of this tutorial series is to explain the entirety of the Hyperspeedcube puzzle engine, including construction and simulation. The reader of assumed to be familiar with basic linear algebra and have some geometric intuition. In particular, they should be comfortable with vectors as a representation of directions and points in 2D and 3D space, matrices as a representation of linear transformations, and the determinant as a representation of signed area/volume.

# Introduction

The goal of this tutorial series is to teach how to develop puzzles for Hyperspeedcube 2.

This series is meant to be read in order; if you don't understand something, try rereading earlier pages until they make sense. If it still doesn't make sense after rereading, ping me (**@HactarCE** or **@Hyperspeedcube Developer**) on the Hypercubers Discord server.

Read the [preface](preface.md) first to make sure you have the prerequisite knowledge.

## Roadmap



Hyperspeedcube makes heavy use of an algebraic system called **Conformal Geometric Algebra** (**CGA**). In order to understand CGA, you must first understand **Projective Geometric Algebra** (**PGA**), which in turn relies on an understanding of **Vectorspace Geometric Algebra** (**VGA**).

Once we have established a solid understanding of CGA, we'll cover the representation of conformal polytopes and various algorithms we can do using them, culminating in the shape slicing algorithm.

After that, we'll define patchwork spaces and extend the shape slicing algorithm to work in those.

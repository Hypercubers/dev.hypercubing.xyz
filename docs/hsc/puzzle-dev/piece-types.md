How to name piece types for an HSC2 puzzle.

A piece that is at the center of the puzzle should be called a *core*. However, if this piece is not fixed, like in the &lt;Rw, Uw&gt; 3Ã—3, it can have another name, such as *anticore*.
A piece that is at the center of a facet of the puzzle should be called a *center*.
A piece that is at the center of another element of the puzzle should be named after that element, i.e. *corner*, *edge*, or *ridge*, as in the 3^n^.

A piece that is not at the center of an element of the puzzle lies between the centers of some nearby elements that are all incident. The piece should be in the top-level group named after a piece centered at the highest-rank element of that subflag. That name should be prefixed by letters corresponding to the other elements of the subflag by increasing rank, where corner is *V*, edge is *E*, and ridge is *R*, except that a V-edge is called a *wing*. In 3 dimensions, *V-center* is replaced by *X-center* and *E-center* is replaced by *T-center*. If the subflag is a flag, it is called an *oblique*. Obliques can have two chiralities that depend on the sign of the determinant of the matrix whose rows are the centers of the elements by increasing rank: if it is positive, the piece is an *oblique (right)*, and otherwise it is an *oblique (left)*.

If multiple pieces have the same name, they should be disambiguated with adjectives. These can include *inner* and *outer* (as in the elite pentultimate's X-centers), *pentagonal* and *hexagonal* (as in the Tuttminx), *big* and *small*, or numbers (as in large N^3^ puzzles).

If an orbit of indistinguishable pieces occupies multiple positions, it can be given a name from outside of this system (as in the bagua cube's triangles, which can be both X-centers and T-centers). Exceptions can be made to this system for sufficiently compelling reasons, such as shapemods where the outer geometry does not match the axis system (like the hexaminx), or puzzles with established piece names (such as the face-turning octahedron's triangles).

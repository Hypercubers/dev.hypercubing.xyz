# Puzzle Development

The goal of this tutorial series is to teach how to develop puzzles for Hyperspeedcube 2.

This series is meant to be read in order; if you don't understand something, try rereading earlier pages until they make sense. If it still doesn't make sense after rereading, ping me (**@HactarCE** or **@Hyperspeedcube Developer**) on the [Hypercubers Discord server](https://discord.gg/3hVSe8rDKa).

Read [Prequisites](../../prereqs.md) first to make sure you have the prerequisite knowledge.

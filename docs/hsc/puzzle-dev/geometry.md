# Puzzle Geometry

In order to build a puzzle in Hyperspeedcube, first you must understand the geometry of the puzzle. Fundamentally, we build puzzles by starting with a base shape, slicing it, and then defining how to transform pieces during twists. We have shorthand words for common ways to do this; for example:

- The 3^3^ puzzle is a **shallow-cut face-turning cube**.
- The 2^3^ puzzle is a **half-cut face-turning cube**.
- The skewb is a **half-cut vertex-turning cube**.
- The Halpern-Maier tetrahedron is either a **deep-cut vertex-turning tetrahedron** or a **shallow-cut face-turning tetrahedron**.
- The megaminx is a **shallow-cut face-turning dodecahedron**.
- The square-1 is a **cube shapemod** of **bandaged 3-layer 12-gonal prism**.
- The Pentultimate is a **half-cut face-turning dodecahedron**.
- The face-turning octahedron is ‚Äî you guessed it! ‚Äî a **face-turning octahedron**.

What do these terms mean? Let's start with the "X-turning" terms:

- **face-turning** means that the cuts are parallel to the face planes, and the twists rotate pieces in the plane of the face.
- **vertex-turning** means that cuts correspond to vertices of the shape, and the twists rotate pieces around vertices.

You may also see **edge-turning**, **facet-turning**, and **ridge-turning**. (We prefer the terms "facet" and "ridge" in 4D, since "face" is used ambiguously in hypercubing.)

- **shallow-cut** means that the cuts are close to the outside of the polytope, and making them closer to the outside doesn't change the puzzle.
- **half-cut** means that the cuts pass through the center of the puzzle.
- **cut-to-adjacent** means that the cuts pass through the adjacent axes.
- **deeper-cut-than-adjacent** means that the cuts are deeper than the adjacent turning axes.
- **deep-cut** is somewhat vague and has a few different definitions depending on who you ask; in this guide, we'll use it to mean "deeper than shallow-cut, and not better described by one of the other terms."

## Shapes and Schl√§fli symbols

Shapes can be described with names, like "cube" or "dodecahedron" or "12-gonal prism." The most important property of a shape is its **symmetry group**, which is all the ways it can be rotated and/or reflected and still look the same. The symmetries of most shapes we care about are a special kind of group called a **[Coxeter group]**, which are written using **[Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams]**. Don't worry if you don't know group theory or haven't encountered these before; most of the Coxeter diagrams we want to write are linear (i.e., the diagram has no branching), so we can write them using **[Schl√§fli symbols]**, which are easier to understand without a strong background in group theory.

Schl√§fli symbols use numbers and curly braces to describe the symmetries of many shapes. For example, here are the Schl√§fli symbols for the five platonic solids in 3D:

- $\{ 3, 3 \}$ = Tetrahedron
- $\{ 3, 4 \}$ = Octahedron
- $\{ 3, 5 \}$ = Icosahedron
- $\{ 4, 3 \}$ = Cube
- $\{ 5, 3 \}$ = Dodecahedron

The first number in each pair tells you what the base polygon is. For a tetrahedron it's $\{ 3 \}$, a triangle. For a cube it's $\{ 4 \}$, a square. For a dodecahedron it's $\{ 5 \}$, a pentagon. (All of these are regular polygons of course, since we want as much symmetry as possible!)

The second number tells you how many of those polygons are situated around a vertex. For the cube, tetrahedron, and dodecahedron, there are three faces around a vertex. For the octahedron, there's four faces around a vertex. For the icosahedron, there's five. You could also think of this as describing the **[vertex figure]** of the shape.

Notice that the octahedron has the same Schl√§fli symbol as the cube, but reversed. This isn't a coincidence ‚Äî the cube and dodecahedron have the same symmetry! To see this for yourself, hold an octahedron with one vertex facing toward you and a vertex facing up. Now put a vertex in the center of each triangular face and connect them to form a cube.

- The 8 triangular faces of the octahedron become the 8 vertices of the cube.
- The 12 edges of the octahedron become the 12 edges of the cube.
- The 6 vertices of the octahedron become the 6 square faces of the cube.

We say that the cube and octahedron are **dual** shapes.

    The dodecahedron and icosahedron are also dual. What properties correspond between them?

    What's the dual of the tetrahedron?

### Case study: the rhombic dodecahedron

Let's look at a fun shape: the rhombic dodecahedron.

- It has 12 faces, all rhombi.
- It is **face-transitive**, meaning the polyhedron can be reoriented to put any face in the place of any other.
- It is _not_ **vertex-transitive**. 6 vertices have 3 edges and 8 vertices have 4 edges.

Some of those numbers look familiar ... 6, 8, and 12 showed up in the cube and octahedron. Indeed, the rhombic dodecahedron has **cubic symmetry**, which is equivalent to **octahedral symmetry**. The faces of the rhombic dodecahedron correspond to the edges of the cube. We'll come back to this later when we start generating shapes.
